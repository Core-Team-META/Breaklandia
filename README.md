Breaklandia takes the classic block breaking game to an addictive new level, complete with stunning sci-fi graphics and sound effects. 

Deflect balls off your paddle and break through colorful formations of blocks. 

Collect power ups to increase the size of your paddle, trigger multi-ball mania or to transform into your paddle into laser turret mode. 

Drop the ball and lose a life! 

Have fun competing with friends or playing solo for the high score.
